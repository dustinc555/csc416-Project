# csc461-project
Programming Languges Semester Project
This repo contains both a client and a server.
The server receives commands from the client and 
returns a result. 

Environment:
  Perl 5
  Linux (Ubuntu)

Usage:
  * To run the server, nagivate to the server folder and run server.pl
  * To run the client, navigate to the client folder and run client.pl
  
If the client connects to the server it will tell you. Once connected it will prompt you
with a list of valid querys to make to the server. The server will alert you when a query is made
with the query string and ip of the client making the request. It will then generate a response for
the client.
